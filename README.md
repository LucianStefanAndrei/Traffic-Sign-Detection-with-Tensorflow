# This is a simple CNN model that I have used for my blog:
It contains both the model, and an additional more complex one.
Prerequisites: 
  1. Download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data
  2. Use the change_images notebook to create additional directories with augmented images for the overcomplicated model
  3. Name the directories accordingly, I extracted all the images in a directory named "gtrsb_traffic_sign"
